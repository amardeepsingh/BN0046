I just try to mimic the classy and elegant <a href="http://www.braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0046BKBKG">Braun BN0046</a> watch into a Pebble watchface.

I even added the date and the moon phase free of charge! They are easily configurable in the source code.

It's my first watchface, so still learning and many things to improve, but it's already usable.

Heavily based on the <a href="http://github.com/jpgarretson/LCD">LCD</a> by <a href="http://github.com/jpgarretson">jpgarretson</a>, so, kudos to him! It was a great ground to learn and develop this watchface.

I also use a custom <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/">Climacons</a> font  created in the excelent <a href="http://icomoon.io/app/">IcoMoon App</a>
